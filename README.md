# MQ-sensor-ppm-conversion

While converting values to ppm, there were some errors while running code from this 
<a href="https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/configure-and-read-out-the-raspberry-pi-gas-sensor-mq-x" target="_blank">tutorial</a>

Later found that there is problem with the library for the above tutorials code, sesnors are giving output with their library in console, but the code provided <a href="https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/configure-and-read-out-the-raspberry-pi-gas-sensor-mq-x">here</a>
 is giving error.

So, i followed the tutorial on this <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-analog-to-digital-converters/mcp3008" target="_blank">website</a>

Just install the libraries told on this <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-analog-to-digital-converters/mcp3008" target="_blank">tutorial</a> other code is same as the first tutorial.
